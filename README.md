Warfarin & AF Risk Hub

A comprehensive web-based clinical decision support tool hosting multiple predictive models for patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) on Warfarin therapy. This hub is designed for educational and illustrative purposes to assist in assessing stabilisation, TTR likelihood, stroke risk, and bleeding risk.

Access the Hub: W-AF Risk Hub

Summary of Risk Scores

1. PRE-TTR Score

Purpose: Predicting the likelihood of achieving a Time in Therapeutic Range (TTR) $\ge$ 70% within 6 months.

Variables: Diabetes Mellitus, Prior Ischemic Stroke, Use of Thyroid Medication, Initial Warfarin Dose, Days to 1st Therapeutic INR, and Total Weekly Dose.

Interpretation: A score $\ge$ 5 suggests "Likely TTR $\ge$ 70%".

2. W-STAB 6 Score

Purpose: Predictive model for INR stabilisation at 6 months.

Variables: Ethnicity, Serum Albumin, Valvular Heart Disease, DM with microvascular complications, Hyperthyroidism, Day of 1st INR assessment, and 1st INR value.

Interpretation: A score $\ge$ 8 suggests "Likely stable INR within 6 months".

3. W-STAB 12 Score

Purpose: Predictive model for INR stabilisation at 12 months.

Variables: Age category, Alcohol consumption, Heart failure, eGFR category, Total dose/week, and Days to 1st therapeutic INR.

Interpretation: A score $\ge$ 6 suggests "Likely stable INR within 12 months".

4. CARIA₂ Stroke Risk Score

Purpose: Predicting the probability of stroke in patients with Atrial Fibrillation.

Variables: Coronary Artery Disease, Age ($\ge$ 60), Baseline eGFR ($<$ 30), INR Stabilisation within 1 year, and Bronchial Asthma.

Interpretation: A score $\ge$ 2 suggests "Likely high stroke risk".

5. FACT-RED Bleeding Risk Score

Purpose: Assessing the probability of major bleeding in AF patients.

Variables: Gender (Female), Antiplatelet Use, Platelet Counts ($<$ 240), Total Dose ($<$ 20mg/wk), Renal Impairment, Ethnicity, and Dose Regimen (Loading vs. Fixed).

Interpretation: A score $\ge$ 5 suggests "Likely high bleeding risk".
